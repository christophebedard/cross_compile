# Contributing guidelines
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.
Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or documentation, all feedback and contributions are valuable.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting bugs and feature requests
Please use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/ros-tooling/cross_compile/issues), or [closed](https://github.com/ros-tooling/cross_compile/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue.
Include as much information as you can.
Details like these are useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The code version or release you are using
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Before opening a pull request, make sure that you:

1. Work against the latest source on the *master* branch.
2. Check existing open and recently merged pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. Open an issue to discuss any significant work

To send a pull request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Write code; focus on the specific change you are contributing. Unrelated changes such as reformatting are not accepted in review.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Open a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides documentation on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
